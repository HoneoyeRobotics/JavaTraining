FRC Java Training

This repository is where our training files for Java are located. You can follow our guide listed above - Building a Command Robot in Java.pdf. You can find the example project from this documentation under the Examples folder.

The PowerPoint from the Java presenation on basics of FRC programming is listed above as well - 018 FRC Java Presentation.pdf

If you want more information on Java, you can search youtube for basics videos. One example is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWYPVz_i7W4


We recommend setting the root of the repository up under C:\SuitsGIT\ so all of the mappings are correct. This project would then be mapped to C:\SuitsGIT\JavaTraining. This structure is required for LabView projects CTRE references.

Use the GitHub desktop app to setup your folder structure.

To get an environment up and running, we recommend following these steps:

## Software ##
You need to download a few things before you get started. Some packages are online packages, which make things easier.
First, download a Ninite installer package. Go to https://ninite.com/
Select the following out of the list
* Web Browsers
	* Chrome (better than IE/Edge ðŸ˜‰)
* Developer Tools
	* Notepad++
	* JDK 8 x64
	* JDK 8
	* Visual Studio Code
* Runtimes
	* Java 8 Runtime
	* Silverlight
* Documents
	* Foxit Reader (Good PDF reader)

Click Get your Ninite when you are down. The file name should have all of the apps that you are installing.
Go download github desktop at https://desktop.github.com/

Next get the WPILib VS Code extension. The current release is https://github.com/wpilibsuite/vscode-wpilib/releases/tag/v2019.0.0-alpha-4
