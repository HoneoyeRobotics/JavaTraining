FRC Java Training

This repository is where our training files for Java are located. You can find the example project under the Examples folder.

We recommend setting the root of the repository up under C:\SuitsGIT\ so all of the mappings are correct. This project would then be mapped to C:\SuitsGIT\JavaTraining
